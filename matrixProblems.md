# Matrix Operations in C

## I. Write a program to perform the following:

0. Accept dimension of a `nxn` matrix
1. Read and print the matrix
2. Compute and print the sum of all the elements in the 0th row  
3. Compute and print the multiplication of all elements in the 1st column  
4. Compute and print the sum of all elements in the anti-diagonal  
5. Compute and print the sum of all elements in the matrix  
6. Print the largest element in the matrix  
7. Print the smallest element in the matrix  
8. Print the largest (and smallest) element on the diagonal  
9. Accept a integer (between `0-n`) from user and print that row
10. Accept an integer (between `0-n`) from user and print that column

## II. Write a program to accept two matrices from user:

1. Perform addition of the two matrices  
2. Perform subtraction of the two matrices  

---

## III. Write a program to:
1. Accept a matrix from user. 
2. Accept an integer value.
3. Multiply the matrix with the integer value and print the matrix.

## IV. Write a program to:

1. Accept a `n×n` matrix from user  
2. Accept an array of size n from user  
3. Multiply the matrix and the array and print the result

## V. Write a program to:

1. Accept two `n×n` matrices from user
2. Multiply the two matrices and print the result
